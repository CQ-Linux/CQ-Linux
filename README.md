# Description

NOTE:
This is a fork of  Build a pi to install on a X86 PC with Raspbian Buster installed.
    The changes are by W1BAW Bruce Wattendorf

CQ-Linux will allow you to get up and running fast with a Raspberry Pi for ham radio.
Rather than downloading a pre-built image where you have no choices in the build, CQ
Linux gives you complete control over the build. It allows you to choose the applications you 
want to install and skip the ones you donâ€™t need. This keeps your pc as lean and mean as
possible. A list of applications available using CQ-Linux can be found below on this 
page. Use it as your base and add additional applications as needed down the road. 

# Needed info for CQ-Linux

During the install you will need a few pieces of information depending on what you choose to install. If installing all apps, you will need:

For Hotspot:
Current WiFi SSID & Current WiFi Password

For Pat Winlink:
Winlink Password & Grid Square

# Install

INSTALL RASPBIAN ON PC
Download Raspian for pc https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/raspberry-pi-desktop
burn the ISO to a DVD or use RUFUS https://rufus.ie/en/ to make the ISO image bootable on the USB drive.

FOR NOW SET THE USERNAME: pi AND PASSWORD: raspberry TO THE DEFAULT PI user cred.

Power up your Raspbian imaged PC, login, open the terminal, and run the following command.

     git clone https://github.com/CQ-Linux/CA-Linux.git \
      $HOME/pi-build && bash $HOME/pi-build/build-a-pi

# BOINC-FREE

CQ-Linux has never, and will never, try to force any user to run BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing). CQ-Linux has always been about giving the end-user a choice in the software they run. It's also the reason CQ-Linux isn't distrubuted as a pre-built image. You have the final say in what you run on your Linux PC. Install as little, or as much, as you choose. While it doesn't include as many apps as some of the pre-built images, CQ-Linux should give you a great base to work with, then you can add additional applications that may be important to you on top. Want to run BOINC? Feel free because freedom is the basis of CQ-Linux. The power is yours and yours alone.

# Available Apps to Install

#### HOTSPOT:
Hotspot is used to generate a wifi hotspot that you can connect-to with other wireless devices. This is useful in the field, so you can connect-to and contol the RPi from a wireless device.

If enabled, the hotspot will only activate _IF_ the RPi is not already connected to a wireless network.  The hotspot will either activate at bootup, _OR_ a maximum of 5 minutes AFTER you have forcefully disconnected from a wireless network. You can tune that detection delay in the settings.
The hotspot default SSID is *RpiHotspot* and the default IP address of the Pi is 10.10.10.10.
(Make sure to enable either VNC or SSH server to remotely connect to your RPi at that address!)

#### Hotspot Tools:
Hotspot tools is a collection of tools designed to make managing the hotspot easier through a GUI interface. https://youtu.be/O_eihSN_ES8

#### GPS:
This will install the needed utilities to get a GPS device configured as a time source on the RPi. Helpful when you are not connected to the Internet since the RPi doesn't have a real-time clock (RTC) and therefore will _NOT_ keep accurate time when powered-off. Confirmed to work with this GPS: https://amzn.to/2R9Muup Other GPS units may work, but have not been tested.
